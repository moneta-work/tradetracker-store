A plugin that lets you create a store from the Tradetracker productfeed.

This plugin gives you the abillity to add a store to your WordPress, based on a tradetracker productfeed. Tradetracker is an affiliate system that has

All you need to do is choose a store connected on tradetracker and add it. Users of your blog will then see the products on your blog and when interested they will be sent to the store.
